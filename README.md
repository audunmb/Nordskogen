# Welcome to Nordskogen

Nordskogen is a fantasy setting that's been brewing for a while. For now the goal is to make a Forged in the Dark version of it, adapting the Blades in the Dark system to heroic adventures in a fairly traditional high fantasy setting. Though, there is a moral ambiguity in classic fantasy adventures, based on it's colonialist underpinnings, where you explore fantastic lands like a conquistador, raid graves and ancient ruins like a Brit, kill orks and goblins like an American settler, fight evil like a witchhunter and rid the land of monsters like royal European wolfhunters.
Just beeing on the other side of the colonialist adventure doesn't necessarily mean you are any better, you still kill and steal in the name of some greater good. So while you are a hero to your side, you are a villain to the other side. 
In Nordskogen, you get to try out the different sides. 

Choose your people and become one of the heroes of Nordskogen. Then choose your people again and become their hero instead, while the heroes you just played become your villains.

## The forest

Nordskogen, the forest north of the mountains, is dark and mysterious filled with wild monsters, lost magic and overgrown remnants of a lost civilisation. 

Once it was part of a huge elven empire, ruled by the _alvedrott_.  The empire fell after a civil war, and most of the ruins are now covered by the forest, even if there a few holdout temples that still keeps the old ways alive and waits for the prophesied return of the _drott_. Others, the victors of the civil war have chosen a freer way of life in the forest as seminomadic farmers and hunters. 

Coming from the south, Nordskovsridderne, human and dwarfish knights who found little to return to in their own lands after the Great War are staking out a foothold in the lost land of the elves. 

Though, the land is full of threats. There are orks, free from the elven yoke, who drive their cattle trough ancient nomadic routes. There are goblins who wield powerful nature magic and ride wild beasts. There are ogres, trolls, speaking crows, ironspiked boars and possibly a dragon or two. And while the knights won the Great War against the Dark forces, remnants of the darklings have fled and found refuge in the forest. 

## Be the heroes

You take the role as the heroes of the forest, but exactly whom you are a hero **to** differ. 
Choose your people among _knights_, _orks_, _goblins_, _elves_ or the _darklings_. 
Then you fight _the dark forces and barbarian raiders_, you fight _to keep your former slavers at bay while you stop the invasion_, you try _to protect the forest from those who destroy it_, you try _to restore the glory of your people or try to stop to those who want to reinstate the tyranny_, or you t_ry to find a new home after fleeing the genocidal war in the south_. 

Whatever side you choose you are the heroes. You fight evil, explore mysteries and find treasures. You protect your people and strenghten their hold on the land. 

Then, when the quest clock is full, you take a break from the heroes you've created. Create new heroes with similar traits, but with a new people. Now you are the heroes on the other side of the same fight. 

A campaign consists of several switches where you take a turn at the different sides in the conflict.
