# Quests 


Murder for hire, brutal extortion, dark rituals, illicit deals, smuggling runs, thievery in the shadows—these are the exploits of the scoundrels of Duskwall—the only chances left for those pushed to the margins and denied the privileges of the corrupt and predatory elite.

Defend the innocent, fight monsters, explore the unknown, uncover the secrets of the forest, revover ancient artifacts, learn the mysteries of magic - be a hero. 

In Nordskogen we play to find out how heroes will be a champion of their people and cause, and what other heroes will do to thwart them. 

In Blades in the Dark, we play to find out if a fledgling crew of scoundrels can prosper in the underworld of a haunted city—and that prosperity depends upon their criminal endeavors, which we call scores. A score is a single operation with a particular goal: burgle Lord Strangford’s manor, assassinate the Severosi diplomat, smuggle a strange artifact from the deathlands into the city, etc. Usually, a score will fall into one of three categories: A criminal activity, determined by your crew type. An assassination, burglary, illicit vice deal, etc. (Crew types and their primary scores are detailed in Chapter 3, starting on page 91.)
Seizing a claim that you choose from your crew’s claim map. Claims help your crew grow and develop. See page 46 for more details.
A special mission or goal determined by the players (like getting a rare artifact to empower one of the Whisper’s rituals).
A score can be long and involved or short and sweet. There might be lots of rolls and trouble, or just a few actions to resolve it. Play to find out what happens! A score doesn’t need to fill one session of play every time. Let it be however long it is.
The PCs can set up a new score by choosing a target (from their claims or the faction list, for example), by approaching a potential client and asking for work, or by being contacted by an NPC who needs to hire a crew for a job.
A score consists of a few key elements, detailed in this chapter: planning & engagement, flashbacks, and teamwork.
