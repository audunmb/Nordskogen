# Deadlings
For aeons we've been bound by Death, having only a limited time and then for ever lost in the emptiness beyond time. After centuries of research, the necromancers found a way to breach the doors of time and bring us back. Now we are free. Trough the holy rites we can live forever. 

Though, the old Kings and Priests feared our freedom and swore to destroy us. We had to fight them, even though we only wanted peace for both living and undead. We drove away those who hated us and built new cities swept in shadows to protect us.

Though, the old Kings and Priests found new allies and even with powerful magic and soldiers brought back from the dead only to fight, we still lost. The master of Death, the Dark Lord who was the first to come breach the gates, was once again forced back beyond the Veil by the Lightbearers. 

As the Knights of the Pontiff burned the holy dark cities in the south, some of us the ran north slipping trough enemy lines to find a safe haven beyond their lands. The relentless Knights are aiming to eradicate any of us still alive.


Some of the shadow people are undead (wraiths, vampires, zombies, skeletons, liches) while others are grey orks, lizard people and humans that we're prepared for the holy rites once their time had come. Among them are even golems built for combat or manual labor. (Zombies, skeletons and golems who lost their master retains bits of that soul, and act independently.)


- Shadow walker (scout)

As the legionaires and the knights, you served in the Dark army, trying to free the world trough the power of Darkness. You were gifted in the ways of the shadow and learned how move trough the darkness, becoming a master spy and scout. 

- Dark Knight

You have sworn the vows, to protect and serve your people. You will protect them even now that your realm has fallen. Maybe sometime in the future you can create a new realm for everyone beyond death, but now you have to fight for the few survivors. 

- Necromancer

Even death may be defeated. This is your domain, both guiding souls back to their bodies if they want to, or adding a bit of your own soul to a body to keep it alive. Trough the holy rites you also keep all of you here, keeping the Veil from once again claiming your souls.

- Dark legionarie

You were brought back from the dead to fight in the war, with the promise of eternal life if you wow. You lost. Now you must seek a new purpose, finding a way for yourself and those around you. 


Dark Council
The council of fugitives are small and without designated leaders. It starts with the Necromancer doing the holy rites, and then anyobe can bring up any question.
