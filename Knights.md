# The Knights

As the Dark forces were fought back by the alliance of dwarfs and men in the south, the Knights that had fought Darkness for hundred years returned to their homelands, but often found little there for them. With permission from the Pontiff, a group of Knights formed Nordskogsridderne (Knights of the Northern forest), and established themselves in the forest north of the mountains. 

Here they have built three castles, S√∏nnborg, the southernmost castle,  Vestborg, a bit west of S√∏nnborg, and the Veideborg which is farther into the forest. Along with the knights, other humans and dwarfs have ventured along and established villages in the forest. As foresters, trappers and traders, as well as farmers these "nybrottsmenn" are building a new future for the sons and daughters of Light.

The knights try to protect these villages as well as the other peoples of the forest. Though, barbarism and darkness are abound in these wild lands. Strange magic, fierce monsters and hostile barbarians stands in the way of civilization and enlightenment.


A wild territory, you aim to bring civilization and enlightenment here, but the wild people here are not all friendly. The orks here are not corrupted by Darkness such as the orks you fought in the South, but otherwise they are quite similar. 
The elves are the remnants of the great civilization in the east, now laid barren by civil war and later on by the Dark forces. Some hold on to their antiquated ways, but most live simple lives as farmers and hunters. 
Though, the Dark elves who started the civil war and the forebearers to the Death Elves you fought in the south, walk freely among elves. The exception is in the few temples still loyal to the ancient elven ways. 

Goblins here are wild, ferocious and hostile. They do not use the dark magic you've seen goblins use in the South, but they still wield great power. As they raid both you and any other peoples in the Forest, they are best eradicated. 
Haugfolk, called gnomes by dwarfs and halflings by humans, are easy to trade with and pose no threat even if they dislike paying taxes. 



- Knight-Brothers

The knights are commanders and fighters, wartorn, but eager to conquer new lands for the Light. 

- Veideridder
In the forest, the heavy knight with plate mail and warhorse is easily outrun and outwitted. The veideridder is the true knight of the forest, knowing the land and how to fight in it. More often with a bow than with a heavy sword, just as often on feet as on horseback, and preferring light armor and green cloaks over the shining white of other knights.


- Priest-Brothers

While the knights use swords, the cleric uses the Light itself to fight Darkness and the forces of Death. 

- Scholar

While the knights use physical might and the cleric spiritual power, you seek the power of the knowledge. These new lands holds many secrets and you aim to wrest them free. 


- Troubadour

While not officially part of any knightly order, troubadours are found with in any castle and often venture out with the knights, both to learn stories, but with the knowledge of both courtly etiquette and common manners may also be an intermediary between the high knights and more lowly people. 

- Weaponsmith

A knight without a sword and shield is no knight, and you make sure that works. Not the typical hero, but among dwarves the weaponsmith's status is that of a commander. You can't forge a weapon you don't know how to wield, so as well as forger you are also weaponmaster.

Castle claims:
Knights are connected to their castle, and live there like a monastic order. The castle order is the crew. The castle is led by the following roles:
Komtur (leader of the knightbrothers and priestbrothers, but only a first among equals)
Kanzler (in charge of seals, records, maps)
'* Slottsmester (in charge of the castle economics, resources and Half-Brothers)
'* Abbot (in charge of religious affairs and Priest-Brothers)
'* Trapier (in charge of weapons and armed non-noble Sariantbrothers)
'* Veidemester (in charge of exploration, hunting and woodmanship)

At the Slotskapitel (Council), players take these roles and deceide the future plans of the castle.
