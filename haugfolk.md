# Haugfolk (mound people) / Veidere
Haugfolk, sometimes called halflings due to their size, live in mounds turned into houses. They are master cultivators, having the richest and most diverse yields in the forest. Though, a few prefer to wander and cultivate the forest itself, foraging, fishing and hunting, closer to the lifestyle of the goblins. 

- Gander

The feared hex-casters of the mound people know magic that is unoticable, but still slowly turns everything against you. They are master deceivers and are despised even among their own, but in their role as protectors and healers they are respected still.

- Thief

Masters of traps and stealth, thieves hold a special position in the haugfolk communities. As the larger people demand taxes and tributes, or simply raid the fruits of the haugfolks work, the thief brings the riches back to the people.

- Minstrel

Much like the human troubadour, and sometimes in company with them, the haugfolk minstrel is welcomed among most of the peoples in the forest. Juggler, acrobat, singer, dancer and sometimes animal trainer, the minstrel entertain while they spread stories, gossip and propaganda. 

- Veider

More like a goblin in their lifestyle, the veider lives off the land as a free nomad. They claim to live the original life of the haugfolk, before they settled, and know many secrets of the land. 

- Guardian

The closest thing to a warrior in the haugfolk communities, the guardians are trapmakers and tunneldiggers, making sure that any attacker that tries to enter their mounds won't leave again.

- Tinkerer

More priced than the minstrel among the other peoples of the forest, the tinkerers also travel around, but fixes and trades utensils of many kinds.
