Alveheiene

Orkeheiene
The highlands stretching into the western part of the mountains. Sometimes also known as Jernheiene, as this is 

Sunnheiene
The highlands, above the wood line, stretching southwards into Nordfjellene (or Sunnfjellene as they are known as by the peoples of the forest). 

Søndreborg, Nørreborg, Veideborg

Nordfjellene
The mountains that separate the forest from civilization, and stretches up along the coast far north. Stretching into the sky at the highest peaks, it has been a barrier for all expansion for the human kingdoms. Dwarfs dig into the mountains and populate the Seven Valleys, but passing North has always been an issue. The only known route is trough the Summer Pass, and even that is treacherous. The dwarven king, XXX, aided the Knights in building a road trough the pass, but it's still only passable during summer. 
Søndreborg is the castle near the pass, and is the main base for the Knights establishment in the forest. 

Tordenhavet
The ocean west of Nordfjellene, known for large sea monsters, gigantic waves and treacherous reefs, maelstroms and thunderstorms.
