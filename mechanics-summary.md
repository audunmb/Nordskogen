# Changes from BitD

Adds archetype as XP trigger for characters. 

Vice replaced by rest mechanics for recovering stress.

Replace Crew with People.

Add some mechanics from Band of Blades (to be explored), at least the rules for having several characters. The story is about the heroes of the peoples.

# Additional

New playbooks, with different playbooks for each people. 

More rules for factions and resources. 

## Switch
The intended mode of play is to play a few sessions with one group of heroes. Then you switch people, create new heroes and play continue in the same timeline. Whatever happened so far has happened, though you perceive this very differently and need to fix whatever your previous characters have done. 

Possibly a clock to deceide when the characters should switch. 

## Council
similar to Band of Blades with overarching decisions for the people your heroes represent.

Probably add playbooks for each council member similar to Band of Blades as well as some mechanics from Legacy.
