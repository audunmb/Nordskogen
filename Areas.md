# Areas 

## Jernskogen
A mysterious part of the forest where the leaves either are red or made from actual metal. Some fearsome animals in this area have metal parts. Somewhere between Orkeheiene and Dragefjellet.


## Gammelskogen
Only a rumour to Knights, and in the deepest parts of the forest, Gammalskogen is dangerous and magical, with aeons old gigantic threes, monsters and mysteries. 

## Ildheiene
A woodless area close to Dragefjellet. Home to elven furnaces, several Fire Temples. 

## Orkeheiene
The highlands stretching into the western part of the mountains. Sometimes also known as Jernheiene, due to the orkish furnaces found here, or Sommerheiene as the cattle only grasses here during summer. During winter, the cattle treks into the forest and the orks follow. 

## Sunnheiene
The highlands, above the wood line, stretching southwards into Nordfjellene (or Sunnfjella as they are known as by the peoples of the forest). 

## Nørrefjeldene
The mountains that separate the forest from civilization, and stretches up along the coast far north. Known as Sunnfjella by the forest peoples. Stretching into the sky at the highest peaks, it has been a barrier for all expansion for the human kingdoms. Dwarfs dig into the mountains and populate the Seven Valleys, but passing North has always been an issue. The only known route is trough the Summer Pass, and even that is treacherous. The dwarven king, XXX, aided the Knights in building a road trough the pass, but it's still only passable during summer. 
Søndreborg is the castle near the pass, and is the main base for the Knights in the forest. 

## Søndreborg, Nørreborg, Veideborg
The three main settlements of the Knights. Søndreborg is close to the Summer Pass and is a proper castle with stone walls and towers. Several smaller villages of farmers dot the area around Søndreborg. Nørreborg is a small castle farther north, protecting a few villages and trading posts. A road leads from Søndreborg to Nørreborg. 
Veideborg is a wooden fortress somewhat west of Nørreborg, acting as an exploration outpost for the Knights. 

## Tordenhavet
The ocean west of Nordfjellene, known for large sea monsters, gigantic waves and treacherous reefs, maelstroms and thunderstorms.
