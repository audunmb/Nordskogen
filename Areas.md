# Areas 

## Nørrefjeldene / Sunnfjella
The mountains that separate the forest from the civilized lands, and stretches up along the coast far north. Known as Sunnfjella by the forest peoples and Nørrefjeldene by the people living south of them. Stretching into the sky at the highest peaks, it has been a barrier for all expansion for the human kingdoms. Dwarfs dig into the mountains and populate the Seven Valleys, but passing North has always been an issue. The only known route is trough the Summer Pass, and even that is treacherous. The dwarven king, XXX, aided the Knights in building a road trough the pass, but it's still only passable during summer. 


## Sunnheiene
The highlands, above the wood line, stretching southwards into the peaks of Sunnfjella. 

**Home to:** 

## Søndreborg, Nørreborg, Veideborg
The three main settlements of the Knights. Søndreborg is close to the Summer Pass and is a proper castle with stone walls and towers. As the first settlement it is also the largest. It acts both as base for the Knights as they expand further into the forest, and as trading hub for the trade going south from the forest. Several smaller villages of farmers dot the area around Søndreborg. 

Nørreborg is a small castle farther north, protecting a few villages and trading posts. A road leads from Søndreborg to Nørreborg. 

Veideborg is a wooden fortress somewhat west of Nørreborg, acting as an exploration outpost for the Knights. There's no proper road, but a river provides a connection to Nørreborg. 

## Orkeheiene
The highlands stretching into the western part of the mountains. Sometimes also known as Jernheiene, due to the orkish furnaces found here, or Sommerheiene as the cattle only grasses here during summer. During winter, the cattle treks into the forest and the orks follow. 

## Tordenhavet
The ocean west of Nordfjellene, known for large sea monsters, gigantic waves and treacherous reefs, maelstroms and thunderstorms. Along the coast, the ocean crashes into the high cliffs of the mountains, making the whole coast impenetrable. 

## Dragefjellet
A solitary mountain stretching up above the forest. Sometimes, smoke and fire spit out from the mountain and the ground around the mountain shakes. According to myth, the alvedrott used powerful magic to imprison a dragon inside the mountain thousand years ago, and the smoke, fire and earhtquakes stem from the dragon that rattles it's chains.
