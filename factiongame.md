Tier, rep and faction status is measured both for the heroes and for their people as a whole. Turf is the most important, and is measured somewhat differently for the different peoples. 

Goblins start with most of the forest as their turf, but with a weak hold on all of it. When it comes to spirits and animals, goblins are at Tier V. 
Nearly any expansion by any of the other people will diminish their turf and/or their tier with spirits and animals in that part of the forest.

Elves start with dots of villages spread troughout the forest, so a fairly large turf, but also with a weak hold. They have Tier IV
