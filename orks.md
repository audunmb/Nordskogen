# The Orks

Orks
The nomadic Orks cross the forest as they've always done, following the herds of skaukveg in their seasonal migrations. Along the traditional paths of the year, they hunt, forage, feast and trade. Though, as the elves started to return to the forest, fighting has become more and more common. 

Animosity runs deep from the time of the Alvedrott, when Orks and Elves were at war. When the Elven civil war ended the empire Orks plundered many temples and burnt Alfheim, the seat of the Alvedrott, to the ground. 
Though, they weren't organized enough to establish any hold over elven lands, and went back to their traditional lands. Ambitious chieftains sometimes organize raids on elvish settlements, especially if they come close to traditional orkish seasonal routes.  Elves sometimes attack orks to keep raiders at bay and as part of conflicts over cattle and crops.

Orks of the forest, skauorker, have brown skin, sometimes with a greenish or grey hue. The protruding lower tusks is the most striking feature, along with the bulky body and a hunched posture.
Sometimes, non-orks are accepted into their people. Most common are Ogres who prefer the safety of Orkish tribes to the solitary lifestyle of most of their brethren, but any outcast from other people may find a place among Orks.

 Orkish heroes start out with one tribe



They are on good terms with most other peoples, though somewhat skeptical of the Knights and darklings. 



- Volve

The volve master many forms of magic that help the people. 

- Warrior

As orks often enter conflicts with others, they have a strong warrior culture. The shapeshifting warriors of the orks, berserker, ulfhednar and j√∏ffur are fearsome.

- Skald

The storytellers of the orks are both diplomats and leaders, and as important to orkish culture as any combat leader.

- Beastmaster
