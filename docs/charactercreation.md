# Party and character creation

Start by choosing your starting people. All players belong the same people when you start, so choose together. 
There are several to choose from, but if you don't know which to choose, start with the Knights. 

Each people has certain goals, they have access to special abilities and resources. Together with the GM you have to keep track of goals and resources, as well as the quest clock. 

Once you've chosen people, start to create the heroes and the party. 

## Character Creation

### Choose your archetype


Archetype describes what kind of hero you are and shape how you act. When you act according to your archetype you get XP. Archetypes are adjectives that describe what kind of hero you are. Choose two archetypes and combine them to describe your character.  
You may create new archetypes if you like, but discuss these with the GM and other players before you use them. 

If you find out during play that the archetype is not right for your character after all, change it. You can also delay the choice to after a session or two to get a better feeling for where you are going with the character.

_The brave_:  you get XPwhen you do brave things
_The strong_: you get XP when you use strength to do deeds
_The stealthy_: you get XP when you use stealth to win a fight
_The smart_: you get XP when you use your wits to outsmart your opposition
_The wise_: you get XP when you use knowledge and experience to solve conflicts
_The good-hearted_: you get XP when you prioritize the needs of others and the value of life
_The charming_: you get XP when you use your charm to get your way
_The leader_: you get XP when you take on the responsibilities for others and guide them. 

_The dumb_: you get XP when you are outsmarted but still win
_The mischievous_: you get XP when you scheme and manipulate to get your way
_The bloodthirsty_: you get XP when you solve conflicts with violence
_The moody_: you get XP when you act upon anger and emotions
_The Avenger_: you get XP when you act based on wrongs inflicted in the past
_The righteous_: you get XP when the means justify the end in your fight against evil.


### Choose playbook

Each people has a set of playbooks that the players can choose from that give them special abilities (which give your character ways to break the rules in various ways) and deceides how others see that character. 
Every playbook represents a part of the society of that people, and the role of that character in the society. It deceides what kind of resources they have access to, and what is their area of expertise. 
You’re selecting the set of initial action ratings and special abilities that your character has access to—but you’re not defining their immutable essence or true nature. Your character will grow and change over time; who they become is part of the fun of playing the game.

Once you’ve chosen your playbook, follow the steps below to complete your character.

Assign four action dots

Your playbook begins with three action dots already placed. You get to add four more dots (so you’ll have seven total). At the start of the game, no action rating may have more than two dots (unless a special ability tells you otherwise). Assign your four dots like this:

    Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character’s archtype, and repeat for the other archtype. 
    Assign two more dots anywhere you please (max rating is 2, remember).

Choose a special ability

Take a look at the special abilities for your playbook and choose one. If you can’t decide which one to pick, go with the first one on the list—it’s placed there as a good default choice.

Special Armor

Some special abilities refer to your special armor. Each character sheet has a set of three boxes to track usage of armor (standard, heavy, and special). If you have any abilities that use your special armor, tick its box when you activate one of them. If you don’t have any special abilities that use special armor, then you can’t use that armor box at all.

Choose one close friend and one rival

Each playbook has a list of NPCs that your character knows. Choose one from the list who is a close relationship (a good friend, a lover, a family relation, etc.). Mark the upward-pointing triangle next to their name. Then choose another NPC on the list who’s your rival or enemy. Mark the downward-pointing triangle next to their name.

Name your character

Choose from the names suggested for your people. 

Start your hero's journey

Why is your character on their way to become a hero? What happened to them so far? How did they end up with the other characters? From here on, you create your character with the other players and together you create the party. 

## The party

The party is a group of heroes, tied together by circumstance and necessity in the face of the threats to their people. 

The party start with a Reputation of 1 and at Tier 1. 

Choose your home

You all come from somewhere. You may not necessarily all come from the same place, but the place you start the game is your home. Depending on your people, it may be a fort, a village, a temple or a tribe. 

Your home has some extra resources, covering food and equipment that you can take out of the home without hurting anybody.  You start with 2 Resources. Each adventure usually requires at least one resource. 

Find you starting quest

Something is wrong, and there is noone else that can fix it. You have to do it. Choose a quest from the list for your people. 

Choose a special ability 

Take a look at the special abilities for your crew and choose one. If you can’t decide which one to pick, go with the first one on the list—it’s placed there as a good default choice. It’s important to pick a special ability that everyone is excited about. You can get more special abilities in the future by earning xp.

Assign upgrades

Your home or something else may give you access to special resources to help you in your quest, called an upgrade. Each people have has two pre-selected upgrades and you get to add two additional upgrades to your new party (so you’ll have a total of four upgrades when you start). 
You can choose from the specific upgrades available to your people or the general upgrades on the people sheet.

When you assign your two upgrades, the GM will tell you about two factions that are impacted by your choices:

 * One faction helped you get an upgrade. They like you, and you get +1 status with them. At your option, spend 1 coin to repay their kindness, and take +2 status with them instead.
* One faction was screwed over when you got an upgrade. They don’t like you, and you get -2 status with them. At your option, spend 1 coin to mollify them, and take -1 status with them instead.

You’ll be able get more upgrades in the future by earning xp.
