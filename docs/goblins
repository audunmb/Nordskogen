# Goblins
When the threes started to grow for the first time, they created the animals, the spirits and the goblins to populate the forest. The goblins, also called tusser, have lived in the forest since. 

Goblins are grey or green, mostly hairless and have sharp teeth. They live in small settlements, tussegrender. Some live in huts, often shrouded in mist and other tricks to hide their whereabouts from other people.
They hunt and forage in the forest, and know the spirits of the forest better than anyone. Though, a darkness has entered the forest and the spirits are restless.  Knights and elves are destroying the forest with steel and fire, while deadlings threaten the balance of life and death itself. 

They despise how the Elves burn the forest and the Knights slash it down. Haugfolk and orks cultivate the forest without killing it, and while not allies it is not as incumbent to drive them out of the forest.


- Beistgaldr

Where the spirit singer call upon the spirits of the forest, the beastmaster call upon the beasts. Unlike the ork berserkers, beastmasters don't change into the animal themselves, but sing to the animals. They may ride any animal, talk with the stranger beasts of the forest and borrown the eyes of animals. 


- Galdr
Every part of nature has its spirit counterpart, every three, bush and river will answer to the galdr. The song of the spirit world allows the singer to communicate with and compel help from the forest.

With their galdr the goblins call upon the spirits of the forest to help them, both in peace and war.

- Hunter

Noone knows the forest as good as the goblin hunters, moving swiftly, next to invisble and without a sound.


- Raider

Goblins donâ€™t fight in battles, they come suddenly and fiercly, taking what they came for, whether it is your goods or your life, and disappear again. Goblin raiders are feared by everyone in the forest, even the mighty Knights.
