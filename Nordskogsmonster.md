# Nordskogsmonster

Area: Jernskogen

### Jernbustsvin
Fearsome boars from the red-tinted parts of the forest known as Jernskogen. While they are the size of regular boars, the bristles are seemingly made of iron. As such, they are even worse to fight than regular boars. Though, the thin iron bristle is often a valuable resource. 

### Skarphornokse
Similar to the regular skaukveg, the skarphorn in Jernskogen has horn that are seemingly made of iron and sharp as knives.

Area: The forest
Regular animals:
Wolf, boar, lynx, elk (moose), fox, wolverines, eagles, falcons, deer, roe deer, bear, crow, ravens, magpies, grouse, beavers or any other animal you expect to find in a Northern European forest. 


## Skaukveg
Longhaired beasts, similar to southern cattle, but larger, long haired and with long horns. While the orks threat them as cattle, the difference between tame and wild skaukveg is mainly how afraid they are of orks. They live in large herds and trek from the forest highland in the summer to the denser lowlands in the winter. 

## Gapagalte 
An enourmous boar, with a maw that can swallow a goblin whole and take an ork in three bites. 

## Trolls
Trolls come in many sizes, but even the largest are often difficult to spot. They are seemingly made of stone, earth and wood, more like the forest itself taking on humanoid form than actual peoples. They mostly sleep, and the older and larger they are, the longer they sleep. As they sleep, plants may grow on them, though these plants will become part of the troll. Some of the mountains in the forest may be enourmous trolls that have slept for centuries. Goblins threat trolls as spirits, but when they are awake anyone may communicate with them. Though, waking a troll will anger them, and you don't want an angry troll. Fighting a troll is like fighting stone, earth and wood, and you can't really harm it. 

## Trollelg
An elk that like trolls seem to be made of the ground and forest itself. It's antlers are made of stone, and is rumoured to have magical properties.


## Horngaupe
A large cat animal with horns, reminiscent of a tiger, but with horns. According to some accounts they are as intelligent as people, though they can't talk. 

## Ormhane

## Trolltiur
Beatiful in all it's colors, but fearsome. Similar to the wood grouse, but large as an ork. It's courtship display, tiurleik, are magical displays of color and light reminiscient of northern lights, but playing around it the forest rather than in the sky. If interrupted, it may attack and the magic turns from playful to deadly. 




Area: Nordvidda
Regular animals: Muskoxen, reindeer, foxes, ermine, rock grouse and other animals you'd expect to to find arctic and sub-arctic highlands and mountains. 


## Tannfryskje
Sometimes black, sometimes yellowish brown, white during the winter. A huge cat animal with enourmous protuding fangs that it uses to tear up it's prey. 


## Unicorn
A huge hairy beast that with large horn on it's nose. The horn is rumoured to have magical properties. They will attack any perceived threat to their pack. Though, higland goblins sometimes ride these beasts.

## Tricorn
Twice the size of the unicorn, the tricorn have a horn on the nose along with two regular horns. More docile than the fierce unicorn, both orks and goblins sometimes mount these beasts. 


Area: Gammalskogen
Known for their gigantic and ancient threes, this part of the forest is shunned even by the goblins. It's rumoured to be home of enourmous animals and monsters, as well as ancient magic. 

## Storkrone
Among the giant trees there's the giant deer. Enourmous, but fast, brave hunters sometimes dare to hunt in the giant forest to catch this prize. The antlers are found in courtrooms far from the forest, as one of the most majestic symbol known.

## Jøtulkorp
The Jøtulkorp is an enourmous raven, with a wingspan the size of four skaukveg, known to have deep wisdom and ancient magic. It lives somewhere in Gammalskogen, but sometimes it roams other parts of the forest and is rumoured to visit important goblin _galdrer_ when it does. Whether it is one ancient raven, or a murder of them remains a mystery. 

## Lindorm
Probably the main danger in Gammalskogen, these enourmous wyrms have sharp swordlong teeth and spit acidic poison. They'll eat people, even though they can talk. 

Area: Myra

## Huldra
Appearing as a beatiful woman (adapting to it's victims species) Huldra tries to lure males into the fen where they disappear in the mists never to been seen again. Some claim that Huldra drags the victom into the spirit world where they keep it as a mate, other claims that the victims drown in the mire while others claim that Huldra actually is an apparition from a monster that will eat the victim. Anyhow, unless you resist the seductive lure of Huldra, you will disappear in the mist never to be seen againg. 

## Morildorm
Smaller than the lindorm, but still large enough to eat you, the wyrm hunts at night, pitch black until you're suddenly blinded by the flash from it's glowing body. 


## Hulderkatt

## Skoddemøya
Similar to the hulder, in that she appears as a beatiful elf woman, the skoddemøy won't attempt to lure anyone into it's waters. Rather shw will attack fiercly anyone that enters near it. Appearing in a thin mist, she dances on the water often seemingly clad in gold, silver and jewels. 


Kjempehjort
Mellom kjempetrærne finnes også kjempehjorten. Enorm og rask, men de modigste jegerne drar noen ganger for å fange den. Gevir fra kjempehjort er høystatus-symboler langt utenfor skogen.

Hornfryske
Stor kattedyr med horn. 


Kimeraen 
Et trehodet beist skapt en av en ørn, en galte og en okse som ble skapt av en alvemagiker for lenge siden. Magikeren er død for lenge siden og siden har beistet bodd ved en klippe et sted i skogen. Orkene hater den siden den stjeler dyr med jevne mellomrom og er umulig å holde unna. Alvene undrer seg derimot over hvordan den ble skapt og hvorfor, men kanskje også på om de kan gjenvinne kontrollen over den.




Trollelg 
En stor og kraftig elg, med lang raggete pels, ofte mosegrodd. Svært sjelden og med trolldom som gjør den umulig å fange. Ofte sammen med troll. Har gevir av stein.
